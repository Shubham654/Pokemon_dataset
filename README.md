Created a DataSet by web scraping through multiple websites.
This data set includes 1045 Pokemons, including their number, name, and basic stats: HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. It has been of great use when teaching statistics to kids. With certain types you can also give a geeky introduction to machine learning.

This are the raw attributes that are used for calculating how much damage an attack will do in the games. This dataset is about the pokemon games (NOT pokemon cards or Pokemon Go).

The data as described by Shubham Chambhare is:

#: ID for each pokemon
Name: Name of each pokemon
Total: sum of all stats that come after this, a general guide to how strong a pokemon is
HP: hit points, or health, defines how much damage a pokemon can withstand before fainting
Attack: the base modifier for normal attacks (eg. Scratch, Punch)
Defense: the base damage resistance against normal attacks
SP Atk: special attack, the base modifier for special attacks (e.g. fire blast, bubble beam)
SP Def: the base damage resistance against special attacks
Speed: determines which pokemon attacks first each round
The data for this table has been acquired from several different sites, including:
